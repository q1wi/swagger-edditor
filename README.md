# Swagger Editor Refactored

A refactored and enhanced version of the Swagger Editor with improved functionality and user experience.

## Features

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Model Creation & Editing**: Create and edit Swagger/OpenAPI models with an intuitive interface
- **Property Management**: Add, edit, and delete model properties with type validation
- **YAML Generation**: Automatically generate YAML specification from your models
- **File Operations**: Save and load YAML files

### ✅ Recent Enhancements
- **Fixed Model Saving**: Resolved TypeError in saveModel function that prevented model saving
- **Sticky YAML Preview Header**: Modal header remains visible while scrolling through YAML content
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying of generated YAML with visual feedback
- **Improved Modal UX**: Better structured modal with separate header and scrollable body

## Bug Fixes

### Model Saving Issue (Fixed)
- **Problem**: TypeError when saving models due to incorrect element ID selectors
- **Solution**: Fixed ID selectors in `js/actions.js` by adding missing underscores:
  - `propName` + propId → `propName_` + propId
  - `propDescription` + propId → `propDescription_` + propId
  - `propRequired` + propId → `propRequired_` + propId
  - `propType` + propId → `propType_` + propId

## Usage

1. Open `swagger-editor.html` in your web browser
2. Use the "Add Model" button to create new models
3. Add properties to your models using the property form
4. Click "Generate YAML" to see the OpenAPI specification
5. Use "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the generated YAML
6. Save your work using the file operations
